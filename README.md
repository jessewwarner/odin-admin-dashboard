# odin-admin-dashboard
This project is to build a mock dashboard

The goal of this project is to build a dashboard using HTML and CSS.
This project will require knowledge of how to use and work with various
HTML and CSS elements, including flexbox and grid. The project states
that I should lean heavily on grid to make the layout, so I will focus
on using only grid to position the elements on the webpage.
